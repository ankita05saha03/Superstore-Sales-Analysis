# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

# Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of sales data from a superstore. The goal is to uncover insights and trends in the data that can help improve the store's business strategies and decision-making processes.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is a collection of sales records, including details on products, customers, and sales transactions. It includes the following columns:

* Order ID
* Order Date
* Ship Date
* Ship Mode
* Customer ID
* Customer Name
* Segment
* Country
* City
* State
* Postal Code
* Region
* Product ID
* Category
* Sub-Category
* Product Name
* Sales
* Quantity
* Discount
* Profit

# Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

* Python: The main programming language used for analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: For numerical operations.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Google Colab: For organizing and presenting the analysis.

# Power BI Visualization

In addition to the Python-based analysis, I created Power BI visualizations to provide interactive insights into the superstore's performance. The Power BI dashboard includes two main pages:

* Total Sales Analysis: This page provides a comprehensive overview of the total sales, allowing users to explore sales trends, distribution, and other relevant metrics.
* Profit Analysis: This page focuses on analyzing the store's profitability, offering insights into profit margins, contributions by different segments, and other key profit-related metrics.

Navigation buttons were added to facilitate easy switching between these pages, enhancing the user experience and making the data exploration more intuitive.
